# Comet Buster FIP1A

A Small C project using SDL1.2 fixed by [Roman G](https://github.com/chaun14) and [Jordan B](https://github.com/jordanbmrd) @ IMT Atlantique
And based on many teacher's work throught the (long) time.

## Features:

- Working game base without too much segfaults
- Sounds
- Startup / Gameover title messages
- High Score save
- Nice health hearts

## Installation

- Please use a real os such as linux to avoid problems :/
- Make sure you have all required depedencies such as `make gcc libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-mixer1.2-dev libsdl-ttf2.0-dev` ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Run `sh start.sh` ʘ_ʘ
- Enjoy :)

BTW if you're using this repo to avoid working on the project that's not a clever idea, always do by yourself otherwise you won't understand ;)
