=============
TODO, one day
=============

 - initial comet number: 20 comets is crazy!
 - cleanup: do we respect proper coding style and good practices?
 - clean linked list: which version to chose between a clean functional one ore
   a classical one?
   - Naming conventions have to be taken, data has to be defined (currently: int value)
 - struct:
   - to keep or not to keep pointer in typedef struct (*sprite_t)
   - private content or not ?
 - are SDL warnings interesting? I am not sure -> clean few flags in Makefile
 - nyancats should fire (not yet implemented) toward the spaceship
 - L and M comets should be split (PoC done in main.c + q&d sprites ok)
 - TODOs and FIXMEs and DEPRECATEDs
 - score (PoC done in main.c)
 - end of level: how to pass a level? destroy all enemies or only all comets?
   (PoC done in main.c)
 - lives
 - display a screen before the beginning (+help), waiting fo an event
 - display score & lives
 - display messages? (level X: 3... 2... 1... go! / game over, score = xxx /
   level X passed, score = xxx, etc.)
 - sound?
 - end of game: quit and relaunch or quick relaunch?
 - remove backward movement?

 - organization of the whole project -> work packages (modules) (meeting this
   week) + what do we give to students? (at least sprites)

 - then, implement skeletons of other ideas among: 
   - probability of nyancat spawn when destroying a comet
   - seeking missiles (smiley)
   - multiplayer (team player or PvP)
   - random objects
   - Bermuda Triangle: magnet / black hole (or the contrary)
   - chaos mode: crazy physics, stream, worm holes, inverted controls, etc.
   - special powers (shield, anti-grav shield, invisibility, teleport, special
     fire, etc.)
   - "you know your cat wants to kill you when...": (powerful nyancats: 9
     lives, shield, life bar, multiple fire, HSC -High Speed Cat-, seeking cat,
     seeking missile cat, etc.)
   - time trial
   - crazy spawning (comets spawn more or less randomly, spawn speed could
     increase with time, nyancats are spawned when a comet is destroyed, etc.)
   - merging comets: collisions between small comets give medium comets
   - energy bar / life bar (for spaceships and/or enemies) / limited ammo
   - power ups (lives, ammo, invincibility, etc.) 
   - cats heaven: comets are replaced by nyancats + nyancat music :)
   - ...

(TODO 2nd player, for instance:
  - w: move forward
  - s: move backward
  - a: rotate left
  - d: rotate right
  - left shift: fire)
